WIP
===

Add cms branch
--------------

Please note: The site previously used the block app, this was partially removed.
To correct we need to fake remove the migrations see below

Pull the latest source from the repository, then refresh the VE ::

  rm -r venv-*     # Make sure there is not space between the - and the *
  create-venv kbs
  cd .

Restore a copy of the existing site and migrate::

  django-admin migrate block zero --fake
  django-admin migrate

Load the block and compose data::

  django-admin loaddata project/tests/data/block_compose.json

Extract the demo media files::

  tar -xvzf project/tests/data/media-files.tar.gz

Run the project::

  django-admin runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

You can view the site on mobile by finding your ip address::

  ip addr

Then on the mobile device enter::

  <ip address>:8000

Contact App
-----------

.. note:: This information is probably duplicated above.

To remove all traces of ``block`` tables (before re-instating them)::

  django-admin.py migrate block zero
  django-admin.py migrate block zero --fake

For notes on removing the ``Contact`` model from ``crm`` and using the
``contact`` app instead, see https://www.kbsoftware.co.uk/crm/ticket/717/

.. tip:: For historial information on moving the CRM data from ``pkimber_net``
         to ``kbsoftware_couk``, see ``project/migrations/0001_initial.py``.
